## Theme: You Are Not The Hero

[Itch.io Gamepage](https://dropmania.itch.io/they-are-the-heroes)

## Brainstorming:

-   playing the villain
-   playing a side character to the story
-   gacha game

## Idea:

-   name idea: They Are The Heros
-   buy heros with a specific currency
-   arrange your partie with your heros
-   fight against other parties
-   if you win you gain money
-   if you lose you lose money
-   idle money farming (send heros to quests)
-   basically gacha :D
